## What this is
Tulkintatila is a structured working format for separating observation from interpretation and identifying the assumption-structure that shapes decisions.
It does not provide answers. It exposes the mechanism by which answers are formed.

## Core model
Observation → Interpretation → Structure

## What it does (operational)
- Distinguishes direct observation from inferred meaning
- Maps the interpretation layer (default explanations, language effects, narrative bias)
- Identifies structural assumptions that constrain what is considered possible or true
- Clarifies where decision logic is driven by assumptions rather than verifiable observation

## Scope / context
Rooted in practical bodywork and wellbeing context, focusing on cognitive structure and meaning-making mechanics.
This is structural analysis, not persuasion or motivation.

## Not
- Not therapy
- Not medical advice
- Not self-help content
- Not generic consulting
- Not a claim of outcomes

## When to use (signals)
- The same phenomenon produces conflicting explanations
- Explanations do not match observable reality
- Decisions are guided by untested assumptions
- Language or narrative dominates over measurable observation
